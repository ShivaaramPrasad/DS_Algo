	/*
	 * 1) Did I understand the problem? Yes
	 * 		-> If No, Ask the person to provide more detail with example(s)
	 * 
	 *    What is the input(s)? String
	 *    What is the expected output? Character 
	 *    	What if there is no second least? ->  print no second min 
	 *    		Example: "abcd" -> 
	 *      What if i have multiple second least? first 
	 *      	Example: "aabbcd" -> c or d 
	 *      Is it case sensitive? Yes
	 *      	
	 *    Do I have constraints to solve the problem? Use Map
	 *    Do I have all informations to go to next step!! Yes
	 *    How big is your test data set will be? Small
	 *    
	 *  2) Test data set
	 *  	
	 *  	Minimum of 3 data set !! Positive, Edge, Negative 
	 *      Validate with the interviewer if the data set is fine by his/her assumptions
	 * 
	 * 3) Do I know how to solve it?
	 * 		
	 * 		Yes - great, is there an alternate?
	 * 		No - Can I break down the problem into sub problems?
	 * 
	 * 4) Ask for hint (If you do not know how to solve)
	 * 
	 * 5) Do I know alternate solutions as well?
	 * 
	 * 		Yes - What are those?
	 * 		No - That is still fine, proceed to solve by what you know !!
	 * 
	 * 6) If you know alternate solutions -> find out the O Notations (Performance)
	 * 
	 * 		Then, explain either both or the best (depends on the time)
	 * 
	 * 		Approach 1: Start with worst -> Improve (Optimize) -> End up with the best
	 * 		Approach 2: Write down the options and benefits and code the best 
	 * 
	 * 7) Start always with Psuedo code 
	 * 
	 * 8) Implement them in the code (editor)
	 * 
	 * 9) Test against the different data set 
	 * 
	 * 10) If it fails, debug them to solve it !!
